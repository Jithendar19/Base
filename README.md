RNASSAC at TAMUC is a research project funded by the NSF to develop,
test and make our tools available to the public (Free of charge) to
handle very efficient RNA sequence searching.  At the conclusion of
this project, the source code will be made openly available to the
public.

The RNASSAC research project is headed by Dr. Arslan at Texas A&M
